## Submission

You can commit and push to your homework project (repo) as many times as
you want until the deadline stated above. The commits after the deadline
on your GitHub will not be counted, and the commit closest to but before
the deadline will be your final version of submission.

<span style="color: red;">**Requirement: Your ENTIRE project should be
synchronized with your homework repo on GitHub. It means that every time
you make a new commit, select ALL files (check ALL boxes in the Git
Pane) that has been modified since last commit!**</span>

## Instructions

For Homework 3, you need to work on the Quarto file, `hw-03.qmd`.

You are welcome to discuss and study with your classmates, and use any
resources. However, this assignment is completely **individual**. You
have to do your own work. **Copying others work without citation is
viewed as cheating and plagiarism.**

## hw-03.qmd

Please type your name in the `author` key in YAML header.

The file `hw-03.qmd` has two parts: **Probability and Statistics** and
**Machine Learning**. **For any simulation or random sampling, set the
random seed at your student ID number, for example
`set.seed(6145678)`.**

Please show any relevant code in code chunks to justify your answers.
